Here are the differents Jupyter notebook used for this project:

graphAlgo :
"""
FOR SCHWINGER
- Build all physical state
- Illustrate some of these states
"""

StringBreaking :
"""
FOR SCHWINGER
- Build all physical state with fixed field at boundary
- Generate the String state
- Time evolve
- Plot E(t)
"""

dimH&Ground:
"""
FOR SCHWINGER
-Build all physical state
- Calculate dimensionality of Hphys
- Calculate the ground state
- Compare ground state to microQLM
"""

microQLM :
